# IO Mocking with Type Classes
This is an example on how to test IO programs by extracting side effects into type classes.
The example was also presented in the paper.

## Requirements

Tests are run using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

## Running Tests

The cabal file `test.cabal` defines an executable test.
You can run the test with `stack run test`.
