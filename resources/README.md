## Check Your Proof (CYP)

Check Your Proof is a verifier for proofs about Haskell-like programs.
Please refer to the [paper](../paper) for more information.
You can find the source of CYP including some proof examples [here](https://github.com/lukasstevens/cyp)
and an exemplary integration of automated CYP proof checking in Tasty in [cyp\_integration](cyp_integration).
