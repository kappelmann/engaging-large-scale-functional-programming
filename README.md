# Engaging, Large-Scale Functional Programming Education in Physical and Virtual Space

This is a work-in-progress paper about teaching experiences,
engagement mechanisms,
and automation tools to successfully run a
functional programming
course with more than 1000 students
in physical and virtual space.

## Abstract

Worldwide, computer science departments have experienced a dramatic increase in the number of student enrolments.
Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires institutions to radically replace the traditional way of on-site teaching,
moving interaction from physical to virtual space.
We report on our strategies and experience tackling these issues
as part of a Haskell-based functional programming and verification course,
accommodating over 2000 students in the course of two semesters.
Among other things,
we fostered engagement with weekly programming competitions
and creative homework projects,
workshops with industry partners,
and collaborative pair-programming tutorials.
To offer such an extensive programme to hundreds of students,
we automated feedback for programming as well as
inductive proof exercises.
We explain and share our tools and exercises so that they can be reused by other educators.
