# Engaging, Large-Scale Functional Programming Education in Physical and Virtual Space

This repository contains the resources of the
paper "Engaging, Large-Scale Functional Programming Education in Physical and Virtual Space"
published at "Trends in Functional Programming in Education 2021/2022" ([TFPIE 2021/2022](https://wiki.tfpie.science.ru.nl/TFPIE2022)).

The paper reports about teaching experiences,
engagement mechanisms,
and (automation) tools to successfully run a
functional programming
course with more than 1000 students
in physical and virtual space.
You can find the paper [here](https://github.com/kappelmann/engaging-large-scale-functional-programming/blob/pdfs/engaging_fp_education.pdf).

As part of the paper, we also share a selected set of exercises and tools.
You can find them [here](resources).
Said exercises were created for the winter semester 2019 and winter semester 2020
iterations of the Functional Programming and Verification course
at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/).
You can find further, though probably less exciting, exercises
of these iterations [here](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fpv/WS20/exercises.html)
and [here](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fpv/WS19/assets/).

Please contact one of the authors if you are interested in
any exercises not published here,
want to have our LaTeX sources,
or if you have any other question.

## Abstract

Worldwide, computer science departments have experienced a dramatic increase in the number of student enrolments.
Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires institutions to radically replace the traditional way of on-site teaching,
moving interaction from physical to virtual space.
We report on our strategies and experience tackling these issues
as part of a Haskell-based functional programming and verification course,
accommodating over 2000 students in the course of two semesters.
Among other things,
we fostered engagement with weekly programming competitions
and creative homework projects,
workshops with industry partners,
and collaborative pair-programming tutorials.
To offer such an extensive programme to hundreds of students,
we automated feedback for programming as well as
inductive proof exercises.
We explain and share our tools and exercises so that they can be reused by other educators.
