\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

\kevin{someone please proof read and rewrite as you want}
As computer science departments continue to grow,
COVID-19 continues to spread,
and imperative programming appears to be the industry norm,
we functional programming educators
have to find ways to make our courses more scalable and
engaging, while demonstrating the elegance and usefulness of functional programming and having to adapt to a mix of teaching in physical and virtual space.
We hope our efforts not only inspired our 2000 students
but also other educators to take on these challenges.
The insights and resources presented in this article proved valuable to us and will hopefully also do to others.

For future iterations,
we plan to keep many things that we introduced during the pandemic and double down on some new engagement mechanisms such as the supplementary workshops.
One thing we want to improve is the
time we have to spend on the weekly competition,
for example by handing some of the workload to student assistants or creating fewer but more engaging competition exercises.
We also plan to stick to the digital open-book exam format
though we as yet have no good solutions to prevent cheating.
