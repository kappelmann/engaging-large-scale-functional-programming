\subsection{Technical Setup and Automated Assessment}\label{sec:tech_setup_test}

\paragraph{Automated Assessment}
In WS19, we used an improved version of
the testing infrastructure introduced in \citep{next_1100}.
However, this system was not able to manage online exams and mark freeform submissions.
We thus switched to use a newly written open-source
tool developed at TUM called ArTEMiS \citep{artemis}.
ArTEMis is a highly scalable, automated assessment management system.
It already offered support for a few imperative programming languages
and we added support for Haskell\footnote{It now also supports OCaml}.
As ArTEMis takes care of anything from load-balancing to
automated testing and
offers a special exam mode and good support for freeform submissions,
the only thing we were left to do is writing the actual test code.
More details about ArTEMis and our test setup follow
in the extended version of this article.

\paragraph{Online Tutorials}

% Previous iterations of the course did
% not make any recommendations about the editor to be used for
% the practical part of the course.
% the retake exam of the WS19 iteration had to take place online.
