\subsection{Selected Exercises and Tools}\label{sec:selected_exercises}

Many students at TUM have questioned the
applicability and usefulness
of functional languages after completing
their mandatory functional programming course.
We believe that is mainly due to two reasons:
1) introductory programming courses often stick
to simple algorithmic or mathematically inspired challenges and
2) side-effects (in particular IO)
are often introduced very late
in functional programming courses.

Changing the latter appeared unpromising to us:
we think that students would be confused
if a ``special'' IO-type and do-notation were to
be introduced before they are comfortable
with the very basic features of functional
programming languages
We henced tried to instead tackle former reason
by creating diverse exercises that go beyond
basic interactions with one's terminal.

In the final version of this article,
this section will introduce a selected list of
useful/creative Haskell exercises and tools
that were created as part of
the course and can be reused by other educators.
All exercises will be made available in a central git repository.
Here are some examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item A mocked IO library that allows property-based IO-testing in Haskell.
\item An implementation of Chain Reaction\footnote{\url{ https://brilliant.org/wiki/chain-reaction-game/}},
including a competition server
and a ranking website with statistics,
interactive, game replay, etc.

\item A music synthesiser framework
\item A turtle graphics\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics}} framework
\item A simple framework to run ACM-like programming competitions
\item A framework for UNO\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)}}.
\end{itemize}
Some further examples can be seen on our competition blogs\footnote{\href{https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fpv/WS19/wettbewerb.html}{WS19} and \href{https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fpv/WS20/wettbewerb.html}{WS20}}.

% The design philosophy of each exercise sheet
% can be described as follows:
% \kevin{TODO: discuss those and change them}
% \begin{enumerate}
  % \item introduce tasks with incrementing difficulty,
  % \item provide instant feedback, and
  % \item offer one creative task that can be solved by simple means but also be enhanced by means that go beyond the syllabus.
% \end{enumerate}
