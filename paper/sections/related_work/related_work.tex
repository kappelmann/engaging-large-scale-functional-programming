\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related_work}

Previous iterations of the course were introduced in~\cite{next_1100}.
While~\cite{next_1100} focuses on the lecture material,
specific exercises, and developed testing infrastructure,
our main objective is to provide strategies and resources to address
the challenges laid out in~\cref{sec:intro},
i.e.\ the drastic increase in student enrolments,
the challenges of online teaching,
and the difficulty of demonstrating the practicality of functional programming.
We also give an account of the improved testing infrastructure
that supersedes the one introdued in~\cite{next_1100}.

TODO other related work.
