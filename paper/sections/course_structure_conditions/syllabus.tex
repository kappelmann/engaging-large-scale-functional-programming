\subsection{Syllabus}

The course deals with the basics of functional programming and the verification of functional programs.
Most parts of the course could be done using any functional language.
We chose Haskell because of its simple syntax, large user community, and good testing facilities (in particular QuickCheck).

The syllabus of the course stayed close to the one presented in~\citep{next_1100}.
Notable changes include the omission of the parser case study -- parsing problems were instead introduced in homework exercises -- and the rigorous introduction of computation induction and type inference.
