- Teaching functional programming to first-year students, S Joosten
  * Used pair-programming
  * Discusses which aspects are difficult for students
- The risks and benefits of teaching purely functional programming in the first year, M. Chakravarty
  * Don't focus on functional programming but on elementary programming techniques
  * Introduce IO early as Hudak does in their textbook
  * Introduce IO without explaining monads
  * Haskell acts as an equaliser because students have no experience with it
  * Live programming
- Teaching the Art of Functional Programming using Automated Grading, A. Hameer
  * Cites papers that state that immediate feedback improves learning outcomes and increases engagement
  * Browser tool that allows to write OCaml programs -> easier than letting the students install Haskell + editor
  * Has access to the student's AST -> can use OCaml's compiler frontend libraries to perform static checks
  * Writing graders is time-consuming -> Re-use graders
  * Students can provide their own tests. Grader checks whether the tests reveal bugs in incorrect (mutated) solutions. Mutated programs are hand-written
- Experiences from teaching functional programming at Chalmers
  * Teach IO early
  * Teach user-defined types early -> students perceive them as easier
  * Showing that Haskell is useful in industry is important. In specific cases, using Haskell gives a competitive edge over other languages
  * Include lecture reporting on ICFP
  * FP levels playing field. Even experienced programmers have something to learn -> increased engagement
  * Ensure that FP can be used in later courses
  * Organised a "Jobs in FP" event
- Teaching Computer Programming: The Macedonian Case Study for Functional Programming
  * Gamification as a tool for learning
  * Combine eLearning with traditional methods since no specific delivery mode is favored
  * Offer web-based editor. Is used almost exclusively
- How to Increase INterest in Studying Functional Programming via Interdisciplinary Application
  * Consultation sessions via YouTube were questions can be asked in chat
- Teaching How to Program using Automated Assessment and Functional Glossy Games
  * Games for engagement
  * Automated feedback and grading with self-built platform
  * Teach user-defined data types early
  * Platform encourages students to write their on tests. Only the results of students' test are displayed since too much feedbakck can be harmful
  * Open, competitive, incremental tasks
